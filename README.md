# Code for Competitive Network Models

Code accompanying the manuscript *"Higher-order interactions stabilize dynamics in competitive network models"*, by Jacopo Grilli, Gyuri Barabas, Matthew Michalska-Smith, and Stefano Allesina. 

The directory `code` contains code in `R` needed to replicate the results in the manuscript. The file `code_identical_rates.R` contains the code for the simplified model in which all species have the same fertility and death rate. The file `code_different_rates.R` the code for the more general model studied in the SI. For each file, an `RMarkDown` document shows simple examples of how to use the code. An `html` version is included for convenience.

Any question about the code can be sent to Stefano Allesina (`sallesina@uchicago.edu`)
